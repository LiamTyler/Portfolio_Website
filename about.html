      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am currently a senior in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. My main focus is in computer graphics, but I have experience in many areas, including mathematics (my minor), operating systems, algorithms, web development, databases, and software engineering.</p>
      <p>Something that sets me apart is my drive to push the limits of any task set before me. I push myself to excel in all areas of my life, whether it is class coding assignments or rock climbing. Regardless of the time or effort necessary. I routinely look back on old projects and think of ways to improve them. This drive to succeed, combined with my passion for computer science helps me excel in all projects.</p>
      <p>I am currently looking for Summer 2018 internships before I begin my masters in computer graphics. Please take a look at my resume and portfolio.</p>
