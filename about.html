      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am currently a senior in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities. My main focus is in computer graphics, but I have experience in many areas, including mathematics (my minor), low-level OS work, algorithms, web development, databases, software engineering, and more.</p>
      <p>Something that sets me apart is my drive to push the limits of any task set before me. In all areas of my life, whether its class coding assignmetns or rock climbing, I push myself to be the best that I can be. Regardless of the time or effort necessary. I routinely look back on old projects and think of ways that I can improve them in the future and am constantly looking for ways I can incorperate new ideas into my school projects. This can be seen in all of the projects in my portfolio. This drive to succeed, combined with my passion for computer science helps me bring a high level of energy and progress wherever I work.</p>
      <p>I am currently looking for Summer 2018 internships before I begin my masters in Computer Science, focusing on graphics, so please take a look at my resume and portfolio and reach out to me.</p>
