        <h1 class="centerText">Ray Tracer</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was the second part to the ray tracing homework. For the first part, see 'HW2: Ray Casting/Tracing' <a href="../HW2/index.html">here</a>. This second part was to take it another step by adding features like refraction, reflection, parallelization, support for triangles, and more. See the features below for the full list.</p>
        <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>The main difficulties I had were with refraction and the bounding volume heirarchy (BVH). I spent hours upon hours debugging them, wondering why they weren't working. Refraction wasn't occurring, and the BVH was making the code run slower. It turned out that both times it was just tiny mistakes in the ray/sphere and ray/bounding box intersection tests. Conceptually, everything made sense though.</p>
