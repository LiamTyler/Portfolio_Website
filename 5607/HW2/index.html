        <h1 class="centerText">Ray Tracer</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project is on using ray tracing to render various scenes. The user provides a scene detailing everything in it. This ray tracer works in 3 steps: Shoot a ray through each pixel, see if that ray intersects and spheres, and calculate the lighthing model for that pixel. I created a GUI to help users load scenes, and run the ray tracer. Currently there it is more of a ray caster, not a ray tracer, since there is no reflection or refraction.</p>
        <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>The main two difficulties I had were in getting the shadows to work properly, and creating the GUI. The shadows for me were tricky because there was a lot of little details that you could screw up. For instance, I didnt realize that when solving for the intersection of a ray and a sphere, you need to check for negative t values that it calculates, even if you know the ray is already ahead of the sphere. The GUI was a challenge to link together the NanoGUI library and get OpenGL to properly load and render the texture. I also had to play around (i.e, fight) with nanogui a lot to get the buttons to synch and resizing events to work.</p>
