        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was an assignment was to get five pieces of code running that were introductions into opengl. The first was first get a window up and running. The second was a colored triangle on the scene. The third was a cube without zbuffering, and the fourth was with zbuffering. The fifth was changing with a spinning teapot to have different shading.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All programs running</li>
          <li>Triangle Color changes (press 'c')</li>
          <li>Teapot moves around and rotates (up,down,left,right and w,a,s,d)</li>
          <li>Teapot is shaded using blinn-phong shading (ModelLoadBlinn.cpp)</li>
          <li>Teapot is shaded using Gouraud shading</li>
