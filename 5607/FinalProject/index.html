        <h1 class="centerText">Real Time VR Ray Tracing</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The final project for this class was open ended. I chose real time ray tracing in VR as my final project. The idea is to be able to have a static scene that is rendered in real time using ray tracing. The user will be able to then move around the scene and turn their head / camera in any direction. The ray tracing is done on the GPU using OpenGL's compute shaders. The compute shader outputs a texture which is the image for that frame. That texture then just gets rendered onto a quad as normal. The key thing is to make it fast enough to run in real time.</p>
        <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>So far, my main difficulties have just been having to learn so many new things. Before this project, I had never: used the cave, used the vive, used minvr, used compute shaders, used cmake, or used visual studio. One of those things isn't to bad by itself to learn, but having to learn all of them at the same time has been a challenge. The other difficulty is making it fast enough to be done in real time. There is a reason video games are not rendered using ray tracing. It's too slow. My goal is that by making the scene static however, I can have it be fast enough to be real time.</p>
        <h2>Code</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/LiamTyler/Real-Time-VR-Ray-Tracing">Link to the github repository</a>
        <h2>Installation / Usage</h2>
        <p>Please see the README.md file on the github repository for more info on how to install and usage.</p>
        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>OpenGL's compute shader to do the ray tracing</li>
          <li>MinVR to handle getting the correct view and projection matrices, and the drawing outputted texture. It handles whether the program is being run on a desktop, VIVE, or Cave</li>
          <li>CMake to build the project</li>
        </ul>
