        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I got tired of checking my grades all the time, so I made a little python script to check them for me. It logs into Moodle where the grades are posted, downloads that webpage, and parses the grades out. If the grades are different than the last time it checked, it will send me an email notifying me about which grade changed and how.</p>
        <h2>Code</h2>
