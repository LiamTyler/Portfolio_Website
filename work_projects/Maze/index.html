        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this lab that I created, students had to download a randomly generated maze, and build a character to walk through it. This was their first week on classes, so I gave them code to navigate to a website, submit a form, and download the webpage. They just had to use that to go to a website that generates random mazes, and download one. After that, they would build a Character class that could walk through the maze.</p>
        <h2>Why I made this</h2>
        <p>As the lead TA for one semester, I was asked to spend an hour or two each week coming up with one or two new lab problems. Near the end of the semester though, when the students finally knew enough to start making fun programs, I wanted to give them a more exciting lab. All of their past labs had been very mathematical and many students admitted to being borded. I spent probably a full day on this. It's not the most exciting lab, but I thought it would be a nice change of pace, and give them code to do a litle bit of website downloading if they every wanted to do it on their own. I also thought they would like the visual aspect of moving a character around through a maze.</p>
