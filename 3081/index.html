        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was a semester long project, and we worked in teams of three. I was the project lead, and did the majority of the coding. We did it in three iterations. The first iteration was to implement some of the classic tools, like a pen, eraser, spray can, etc. The second iteration we had to implement different filters such as blur, edge detection, saturation, and more. We also had to add undo/redo, as well as png and jpeg loading and saving. For the third iteration, we had to turn our app into a library, and provide a command line interface. We also had to support the stacks of CT brain scan images and a way to edit all of those simultaneously. For each stage, we had to create a UML document and a design justification document.</p>
        <h2>Extra</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed this project a lot, so I added to the project unrelated to class. Some of the filters can take a long time to execute because each pixel has to at dozens of pixels surrounding it. I decided to make the application multi-threaded. I created a thread pool, and then would assign each thread a portion of the image to filter when necessary. It compiled and worked, but I actually only noticed about a 2x speed up. I never merged it in because I didn't want to add complexity for my teammates, but it was a fun experiment.</p>
