        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was my final project for my first computer science class. I used Python and the TKinter library to recreate a little portion of the old Space Invaders game. There is only one working level, but I only had a week to finish it. One of my favorite projects for a computer science class honestly. I went back at one point to fefactor this and make it better, but ultimately decided I should just learn C++ and graphics with that instead.</p>
